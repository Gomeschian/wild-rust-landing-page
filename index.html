            <h3>Mary and I absolutely loved your performance!
             Since I didnâ€™t know you were into this kind of music,
               I was totally taken aback; You caught the spirit and honest
                energy of it so beautifully! I think Wild Rust is a solid
                 group; you guys are totally in synch, your musicianship is tight.</h3>
